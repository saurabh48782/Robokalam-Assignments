This repository contains assignments given in Robokalam's technical round. 

**XAI.docx file contains summary of my learnings on XAI in approx. 100 words.**

## Face Detection Model
### Face Detection folder contains the source code for making the face detection model.
Tech Stack Used:
1. **Python**
2. **OpenCV** (OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.)
For more information about OpenCV check out: **https://opencv.org/**
3. **Flask** (Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.)
For more information about Flask check out: **https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/**

-> '**app.py**' inside Face Detection folder contains the written source code.
I've made use of **[Haarcascades Classifier](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html)** to detect faces in real-time.

The model detects several faces in real-time and shows the output for a single face (the biggest face in terms of area) along with the named caption.

## Python Chatbot
### Chatbot folder contains the source code for making the chatbot.
It is command line based chatbot.
